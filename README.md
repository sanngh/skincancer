## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
- It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 : Model has initial accuracy is 87% and validation is 78%
- Conclusion 2 Validation loss is 
- Conclusion 3 Model was overfit, so data_augmentation
- Conclusion 4 rebalance was found and up scaling is used
- Conclusion 5 final accuracy is
